{"cells": [{"metadata": {"collapsed": true}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Nantes: The West Coast of France"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Introduction"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Tucked in the northwest of France is the thriving city of Nantes with close to 1 million habitants. It is located close to the beaches envelopping the Atlantic Ocean where activities such as surfing, sailing, and kayaking are especially popular. In recent years, Nantes has been experiencing a growing economy due to the increase in industrial activities by large enterprises such as Airbus (airplane manufacturer), Alstom (producer of railway components), and Eurofin (biotechnology company) as well as smaller technology-related startups and companies. For this reason, Nantes has one of the lowest unemployment rates (6%) as compared to the rest of France (around 9%). All of these positive points in addition to the temperate weather makes Nantes a great city to live. However, despite the relatively high standard of living in this city, the crime rate has recently faced an upturn due to the increase in alcohol and illicit drug consumption. Since Nantes is in France, there is a paucity of information in English on important subjects such as early education and details of residential areas, especially areas to avoid. Navigation of the sites in French is difficult (even for those who speak French fluently such as myself) and to the best of my knowledge, there isn't any truly informative data on living in Nantes in English. Thus, in this report, I will examine in detail the different neighbourhoods in the metropole of Nantes to find the best schools and locations to live. For expats living in France, the location of bilingual or international schools as well as residential areas that are close to transportation, shopping, etc. would be especially helpful. This report will be a useful guide to those who will or wish to move or have recently moved with their family to Nantes to start a new life, especially those who are not yet fluent in French."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "***"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Data"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "In this report, I will use Wikipedia as well as other online sources printed in French in combination with Foursquare location data to examine the different neighbourhoods (*quartiers*) in Nantes. Using these information, I will find (1) schools (elementary vs. high school, public vs private, french vs bilingual/international), (2) public transportation close to schools, (3) detailed information such as venues of each neighbourhood, (4) areas to avoid, (5) average property prices of each neighbourhood, and (6) top areas to live. All of this data will be superimposed on a map of Nantes with the neighbourhoods clearly labelled. Especially for expats who wish to put their children in schools that have English programs, it would be very useful to know where the international or bilingual schools are located. Further, some believe that the education in private schools may be superior to that in public schools in France, thus, the location of private schools would also be helpful. Since France is moving towards greener living, more and more people are taking public transporation to school rather than arriving by car. Therefore, I will also include information on the proximity of public transportation to schools. The latter part of my report will focus on residential data. I will try to include the most important aspects of residential planning, such as nearby venues, neighbourhoods that have a bad reputation, and average prices in each neighbourhood. This latter point will probably not be found by the Foursquare localization app, so other sources (ie. Wikipedia, etc) will be used to find this information and then it will added to the other data. Lastly, I will give recommendations on the top areas to live based on the data that I have gathered. These data will be very helpful for new/prospective immigrants to Nantes, especially those who do not understand French well."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.10", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
