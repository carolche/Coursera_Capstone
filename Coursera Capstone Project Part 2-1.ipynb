    "  Tucked in the northwest of France is the thriving city of Nantes with close to 1 million habitants (including population in the suburbs). It is located close to the beaches envelopping the Atlantic Ocean where activities such as surfing, sailing, and kayaking are especially popular. In recent years, Nantes has been experiencing a growing economy due to the increase in industrial activities by large enterprises such as Airbus (airplane manufacturer), Alstom (producer of railway components), and Eurofin (biotechnology company) as well as smaller technology-related startups and companies. For this reason, Nantes has one of the lowest unemployment rates (6%) as compared to the rest of France (around 9%). All of these positive points in addition to the temperate weather makes Nantes a great city to live. However, despite the relatively high standard of living in this city, the crime rate has recently faced an upturn due to the increase in alcohol and illicit drug consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Since Nantes is in France, there is a paucity of information in English for new or would-be immigrants to Nantes about the different neighbourhoods, especially pertaining to early education and desirable residential areas, as well as areas to avoid. Navigation of the sites in French is difficult (even for those who speak French fluently such as myself) and to the best of my knowledge, there aren't any truly informative data on living in Nantes in English. Thus, in this report, I will examine in detail the different neighbourhoods in the metropole of Nantes (excluding the suburbs) to find schools, types of venues, and best locations to live. For expats living in France, the location of bilingual or international schools as well as residential areas that are close to transportation, shopping, etc. would be especially helpful. This report will be a useful guide to those who will or wish to move or have recently moved with their family to Nantes to start a new life, especially those who are not yet fluent in French."

    "In this report, I will use Wikipedia as well as other online sources printed in French in combination with Foursquare location data to examine the different neighbourhoods (quartiers) in Nantes. Using these information, I will find (1) detailed information such as venues of each neighbourhood, (2) schools (elementary, high school, nursery, and bilingual/international), (3) areas to avoid due to the high level of crime and other types of illicit/illegal activities, (4) average property prices (in € per m^2) of each neighbourhood, and (6) top areas to live. All of these data will be superimposed on a map of Nantes with the neighbourhoods clearly labelled. Depending on the lifestyle of the those who wish to move to Nantes, the type of venues and access to public transportation in the neighbourhoods would be useful to know when choosing a place to live. Especially for expats who wish to put their children in schools that have English programs, it would be very useful to know where the international or bilingual schools are located. I will also include other important aspects of residential planning, such as neighbourhoods that have a bad reputation and average prices in each neighbourhood. This latter point will probably not be found by the Foursquare localization app, so other sources (ie. official documents from the goverment or real estate agencies) will be used to find this information and then it will added to the other data. Lastly, I will give recommendations on the top areas to live based on the data that I have gathered. These data will be very helpful for new/prospective immigrants to Nantes, especially those who do not understand French well."

    "In this analysis, I used Beautiful Soup to webscrape information off of html webpages, such as Wikipedia. I also downloaded a pdf file containing information on areas in Nantes that have a high crime rate as well as illicit/illegal activities from the Academie de Nantes, which is part of the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports that governs formal education and provides youth support. I used tabula to read the pdf into a pandas dataframe. I also downloaded a pdf file (Barometre de Prix, version April 2021) from the official Loire-Atlantique (the prefecture to which Nantes belongs) Notary Public website that contains recent information on the home prices in Nantes. However, the latter was not readable by tabula or other libraries in python so I had to convert the pdf into a csv to read the table about Nantes home prices into a dataframe.\n",
    "To find the geographical coordinates of the neighbourhoods and other venues, I used geocoder. However, I found that geocoder sometimes gave the wrong coordinates due to other venues with the same or similar name. Thus, I had to run the geocoder sometimes with more precise or slightly modified names. Using these coordinates given by geocoder, I used folium to create maps.\n",
    "In order to search for and explore venues in the neighbourhoods of Nantes, I used the Foursquare app. I was able to find the top 10 venues in the 11 neighbourhoods of Nantes as well as the different types of schools (elementary, high school, nursery, and bilingual/international) in these neighbourhoods.\n",
    "Finally, in consideration of the home prices, top 10 venues, schools, and population density, I made recommendations of the most suitable places to live in Nantes."

    "Another very important aspect to consider when choosing a neighbourhood in a new city to live in is safety and security. Although Nantes is a city that is economically stable with low unemployment rate, there are some problems with crime. There is quite a high rate of theft/robbery (60.43%) followed by personal violence (12.51%). In Nantes, as in many other cities, the latter is mostly linked to neighbourhoods that are considered not so safe due to a high level of illicit/illegal activities, such as prostitution, drug use, alcohol abuse, etc. The government of France regularly issues a list of areas that are \"les quartiers prioritaires de la politique de la ville\" (QPV), which are considered as \"urban renewal projects\", \"urban red zones\", \"urban no-go zones\", or \"inner-city projects\" in English. Thus, I obtained data that showed neighbourhoods to avoid in Nantes.\n",
    "I downloaded an official copy of the \"LISTE DES ZONES URBAINES SENSIBLES\" which was released by the Academie de Nantes, the organization in Nantes that governs education and youth support. I then used tabula to read the pdf into a pandas dataframe. Since tabula output is actually a list of dataframes, I chose the first one (avoid[0]) that contains the list of QPV in Nantes."

    "After obtaining all the necessary data, I analyzed all the accumulated information to find the best neighbourhoods to live in Nantes. A definition of a nice neighbourhood to reside in largely depends on the preferences and lifestyle of the residents. For a family with small children, it would be ideal to live in a neighbourhood that is medium-priced, not very dense with easy access to parks, shops, and public transportation. Further, proximity to schools and a safe environment are also very important. If the residents are a young couple or single, proximity to entertainment venues, restaurants, and coffee shops may be attractive attributes in a neighbourhood. In any case, neighbourhoods that are considered as QPVs may not be sought after. Thus, I removed the 5 neighbourhoods that are considered as QPVs (Bellevue, Dervallieres, Malakoff, Bottiere, and Nantes Nord) from our dataframe."

Since Centre-ville and Ile de Nantes seem to have a lot of entertainment venues (bars, restaurants, etc), they may not be so suitable to raise a family, so they were dropped too which left us with 4 neighbourhoods that are suitable for families with kids: Hauts Pave-St. Felix, Breil-Barberie, Nantes Erdre, and Nantes Sud."

    "In consideration of the home prices and types of venues in these 4 neighbourhoods, we would notice that Hauts Pave-St. Felix appears to be quite an affluent neighbourhood that is close to public transportation, shops, restaurants, and playground, which would be a highly desirable residential area for wealthy families. Further, there is a high number of elementary, high, and nursery schools in this neighbourhood which would be convenient for taking the kids to school. However, the population is relatively high in this area so may be quite dense and crowded. This suggests that the living quarters may be small for a high price.\n",
    "For middle income families, I would recommend Breil-Barberie in consideration of the home prices, which are below average as compared to the average home price in Nantes as a whole (best_neighbourhoods2[0]), and the types of venues. The latter includes easy access to public transportation, shops, and parks, which makes it ideal for average income families. Further, the population is also not as high as in the Hauts Pave-St. Felix area, which may be explained by the presence of more parks in the area. On top of that, there are also many different schools in this neighbourhood as compared to Nantes Erdre which has a similar home price and venue profile, but with a lot less schools. I think that Nantes Sud may also be less desirable because the population is so low as compared to the other areas (about 2.5-3 times lower) and the home prices are quite a bit below average (especially for old homes) suggesting that this neighbourhood may not be as developed as the other areas. However, for those who prefer living closer to the country-side, this neighbourhood would be ideal for them.\n",
    "In contrast, there are no bilingual/international schools in these areas, but if those schools are desired, the easy access to public transportation in both neighbourhoods renders the commute to school easier."

The old home prices are considerably lower and the new home prices are much higher than average Nantes prices which suggests that there is a dichotomy of this neighbourhood. The population in this area is also quite a bit lower than in the other areas (except Nantes Sud) without the presence of parks (which take up space) suggesting that there are fewer residents and more venues in this neighbourhood."

    "In conclusion, my analysis showed that there are 6 out of 11 neighbourhoods that are relatively safer to live in Nantes. For affluent families, Haut Paves-St. Felix and Centre-ville have the highest home prices, but also most number of schools. The latter also has 2 bilingual/international schools. Haut Paves-St. Felix is more suitable for residents who prefer a more kids-oriented environment, while Centre-ville has more entertainment venues and very few parks/playgrounds. For middle-income families, I recommend Breil-Barberie which also has a good number of schools, the home prices are average, the population is also average, and the top 3 venues are grocery store, park, and tram stop. Thus, this neighbourhood would be great for families with kids since it isn't very dense and very convenient to shop, play, and commute. These points make the neighbourhood of Breil-Barberie a good place for a middle-income family to settle."
